Website hosted on Github Pages.  For high-level web framework uses Django.
Makes use of Python, HTML, Javascript, and CSS.

Goal of Finer Financing is to assist people in increasing their financial literacy.
The user selects what age range they fall into, and we give them achievable goals appropriate for their age.
Articles are available for the user to see which allows them to be interested in, and add, more financial goals.
Each goal is broken down into tasks, and when the user completes a goal/task they are given experience points.
Experience points are for the user's own motivation.
